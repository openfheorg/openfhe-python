# the workflow_call block was added to this manual workflow (on workflow_dispatch:) because
# it has to be included if a reuseable workflow is called.
# The changes from the workflow_dispatch inputs to the workflow_call inputs are:
# - "type: choice" is replaced with "type: string"
# - all "options:" are removed
# The variable/tag for the runner (var.RUNNER) is defined on the "Actions secrets and variables" page, tab "Variables":
# https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/settings/variables/actions
